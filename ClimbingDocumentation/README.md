## Description of the Climbing Documentation App

---

<br>

This app will let climbers record climbs that they have completed. The user will provide details about the climb (boulder vs. roped climb, name of the climb, difficulty, and date completed), and they can then navigate to the second activity window to view their entries. Using the next and last buttons they can navigate through and look at all the climbs they have completed.
